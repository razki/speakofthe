# 🧠 SPEAKOFTHE — Project Brain

This vault is the **single source of truth** for the `speakofthe` project. It documents
how the project is built, why decisions were made, and how to extend it — for both
humans and AI agents (Claude Code, Cursor).

> [!info] What is this project?
> `speakofthe` is a Next.js 16 consultancy site derived from Textura's Cortex
> template. DOM motion is spring-based. API routes run server-side; the AWS
> runtime is deployed behind the existing CloudFront site. See [[aws-deployment]].

## 🔌 Obsidian setup

Open this folder (`obsidian/`) as an Obsidian vault. Recommended:
- **Graph view** — see how specs, components, and hooks connect

- **Templates core plugin** — point it at the `templates/` folder
